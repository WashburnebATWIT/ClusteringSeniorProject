# ClusteringSeniorProject
### Abstract
This project presents a portfolio investment tool, focused on optimizing asset al-location through clustering. By leveraging historical stock data, stocks are grouped into distinct clusters to identify patterns in performance and risk profiles. From each clus-ter, representative stocks are selected to construct diversified portfolios based on three different methods: top average close price, top return, and lowest volatility. From here, these portfolios are evaluated using cumulative return metrics and benchmarked against the S&P 500 and 10-Year Treasury yield to assess performance. The tool aims to assist everyday investors without access to expensive financial advisors by harnessing clustering algorithms to build smarter, more diversified portfolios using only public data.
